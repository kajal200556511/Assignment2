                        Needless to say, I keep her in check<br>
                        She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)<br>
                        Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)<br>
                        Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)<br><br>

                        Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip<br>
                        Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt<br>
                        Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt<br>
